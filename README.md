# dotfiles

The main porpouse of this repo is to use it as a backup to my dotfiles but you can grab anything you need. I am planning to automate the installation and configuration using Ansible,
so I can easily install my config in any of my workstations. There are several configuration files in the repo, some of them are: 

| [awesome](.config/awesome/) | [fish](.config/fish) | [bash](.bashrc) | 
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| [gnome](.config/gnome-settings.conf) | [alacritty](.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml) | [picom](.config/picom/picom.conf) |

In my main workstation I use Gnome as DE, but I also use Awesome WM for my laptop and VM's.
